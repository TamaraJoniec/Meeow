      "<p><strong>Join us for Exchange Hour Networking on Meeow to connect with other founders on our Exchange programmes across Leeds and Manchester.</strong></p><p></p><p>These networking sessions are designed to increase peer to peer support across both cohorts - letting you share experiences, support one another with advice and knowledge, grow your network, and make introductions to people who can help you with challenges such as fundraising, recruitment, marketing, and operational challenges.</p><p></p><p>Run at the same time every week, these networking sessions provide the opportunity to catch up in an easy, automated meeting space with your fellow founders.<br><br>There's no limit to the number of Exchange members who can attend each meeting of the Exchange Hour Networking, but you'll be matched automatically with other community members in virtual networking rooms of no more than 4 for 45 mins of automatically guided networking. Networking on Meeow doesn't need a host, the meeting software will guide you through each event, plus you can create your own breakout rooms at the end of every session.<br><br>Exchange Hour will take place every Wednesday at 12pm and YOU CAN ONLY ACCESS THESE SESSIONS BETWEEN 12PM &amp; 12.02PM. This is to ensure attendees are split into the most advantageous groups of up to 4. You will not be able to access the session after 12.02pm.<br><br>Before your first session you will need to register on the platform and create your profile. Click BOOK NOW to begin this process.</p><p><br>So book now and make every week an Exchange Hour Networking week!</p>",

      "<p><strong>Join us for Exchange Hour Networking on Meeow to connect with other founders on our Exchange programmes across Leeds and Manchester.</strong></p><p></p><p>These networking sessions are designed to increase peer to peer support across both cohorts - letting you share experiences, support one another with advice and knowledge, grow your network, and make introductions to people who can help you with challenges such as fundraising, recruitment, marketing, and operational challenges.</p><p></p><p>Run at the same time every week, these networking sessions provide the opportunity to catch up in an easy, automated meeting space with your fellow founders.<br><br>There's no limit to the number of Exchange members who can attend each meeting of the Exchange Hour Networking, but you'll be matched automatically with other community members in virtual networking rooms of no more than 4 for 45 mins of automatically guided networking. Networking on Meeow doesn't need a host, the meeting software will guide you through each event, plus you can create your own breakout rooms at the end of every session.<br><br>Exchange Hour will take place every Wednesday at 12pm and YOU CAN ONLY ACCESS THESE SESSIONS BETWEEN 12PM &amp; 12.02PM. This is to ensure attendees are split into the most advantageous groups of up to 4. You will not be able to access the session after 12.02pm.<br><br>Before your first session you will need to register on the platform and create your profile. Click BOOK NOW to begin this process.</p><p><br>So book now and make every week an Exchange Hour Networking week!</p>",

Networking on Meeow doesn't need a host, the meeting software will guide you through each event, plus you can create your own breakout rooms at the end of every session.<br><br>Exchange Hour will take place every Wednesday at 12pm and YOU CAN ONLY ACCESS THESE SESSIONS BETWEEN 12PM &amp; 12.02PM. This is to ensure attendees are split into the most advantageous groups of up to 4. You will not be able to access the session after 12.02pm.<br><br>Before your first session you will need to register on the platform and create your profile. Click BOOK NOW to begin this process.</p><p><br>So book now and make every week an Exchange Hour Networking week!</p>",

Networking on Meeow doesn't need a host, the meeting software will guide you through each event, plus you can create your own breakout rooms at the end of every session.<br><br>Exchange Hour will take place every Wednesday at 12pm and YOU CAN ONLY ACCESS THESE SESSIONS BETWEEN 12PM &amp; 12.02PM. This is to ensure attendees are split into the most advantageous groups of up to 4. You will not be able to access the session after 12.02pm.<br><br>Before your first session you will need to register on the platform and create your profile. Click BOOK NOW to begin this process.</p><p><br>So book now and make every week an Exchange Hour Networking week!</p>",
